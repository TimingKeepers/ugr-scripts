Description:      Brief readme file to use uboot-mkimage.sh

============================================================

To make use of uboot-mkimage.sh, you will need a copy of the ugr-scripts
repository which is available at https://github.com/TimingKeepers/ugr-scripts

The script can be found at <repo_directory>/U-boot/uboot-mkimage.sh


First of all, you will need to export an environment variable:

  $ export SCRIPT_BASE_FOLDER=/absolute/path/to/repository/ugr-scripts


Then, if you have a uramimage.image.gz file and you want to unpack it to some
location, just run:

  $ ./uboot-mkimage.sh -m unpack -r /absolute/path/where/image/will/be/unpacked -i /absolute/path/to/uramdisk.image.gz


Or the other way around (packing rootfs to a file):

  $ ./uboot-mkimage.sh -m pack -r /absolute/path/where/image/will/be/unpacked -i /absolute/path/to/uramdisk.image.gz


Easy!
